# 🚀 auto-os-update: Your Automated OS Update Script

Tired of manually updating your VPS? This script automates OS updates, keeping your server secure and running smoothly with minimal effort! 😎

## ✨ Features

*   **Smart OS Detection:** Automatically figures out if you're running Debian/Ubuntu or CentOS/RHEL/Fedora. No need to specify anything!
*   **One-Command Updates:** Handles the entire update and upgrade process using `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`—whichever is right for your system.
*   **Keeps You Informed:** Logs all actions so you can easily review what happened. Perfect for peace of mind. 📜
*   **Hands-Free Operation:** Runs without needing you to babysit it. Just launch and go!
    *   **Example Use Case:**  Imagine setting up a new Minecraft server.  Run this script once a week via `cron` to automatically apply security updates. 🛡️

## 💻 Usage

1.  **Download the script:**

    ```bash
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodersPlanetHQ/auto-os-update/main/auto-os-update.sh -O auto-os-update.sh
    ```

2.  **Make it executable:**

    ```bash
    $ chmod +x auto-os-update.sh
    ```

3.  **Run as root:**

    ```bash
    $ sudo ./auto-os-update.sh
    ```

## ⚠️ Important - Please Read! ⚠️

*   **Root Access Required:** This script needs root privileges (that's why you use `sudo`).
*   **Reboot Responsibly:** The script won't automatically reboot. Check if a reboot is needed after running it (the logs can help!).
*   **Test First!** We *strongly* recommend testing on a non-production system before using it on a live server. Think of it as a fire drill for your updates. 🚒
*   **Monitor the Logs:** Keep an eye on the logs for any potential issues.
*   **Customize as Needed:** Feel free to modify the script to fit your specific needs! Add custom package installs or service configurations.
